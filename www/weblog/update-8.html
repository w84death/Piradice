</p>
<p>Piradice has been nominated to the grand prize at the <a href="http://pixelheaven.pl/en/" title="Pixel Heaven">Pixel Heaven 2013</a> contest for the best indie game in Poland. We are really happy. We'll be showing Piradice on that event at 15-16 June in Warsaw.

<h3>Manual</h3>
<p>Real life manual is ready! Now there is no excuse that You don't known how to play the game :)
</p>
<h3>Animated terrain</h3>
<p>I'm experimenting with the animated terrain. It is very cute effect. 
</p>
<h3>The map</h3>
<p><img src="/media/blog/piradice-update8_map.jpg" alt="Map" title="" />
Now the game looks like it was played on a real map laying on the table. It was my purpose from the beginning to simulate table-top game. And for that feeling I turned off fog of war feature. It was too much WarCraft-ish :)
</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<ul><li>each turn player is given 5 gold and 1 tree.
</li><li>additionally for each:
<ul><li>ship +4 gold
</li><li>fort +2 gold, +1 tree
</li><li>cementery +4 gold
</li><li>bonfire +5 gold
</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>This change is made to prevent ending the game because there is no more trees on any island. Also each turn two new trees grow up randomly on the island next to the other tree. So they will grown only when there is at last one tree!
</p>
<ul><li>higher prices for some units</li>
	<li>hash url and map sharing temporary turned off
</li><li>new background music and some placeholders sound effects
</li><li>on/off audio in game
</li><li>lots and LOTS of bug fixes
</li></ul>
<h3>AI</h3>
<p>The artificial intelligence or computer player is back! It's very simple and quite stupid. But it is a starting point for future improvements. 
</p>
