<p>Welcome to my dev blog about making the game Piradice. For this purpose I coded blog engine for simple web logging the progress of making the game. The engine itself is written in PHP and posts are written in iA Writer and then export to html files for each entry. Simple as that.</p>

<p>What about Piradice? Now I'm writing some documentation and manual. I'm putting together all the ideas for final version. The document will be published here for discussion.</p>
