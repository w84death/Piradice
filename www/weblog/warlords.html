<p>I saw Warlords official remake on App Store (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/warlords-classic-hd-official/id532024361?mt=8" alt="Warlords Classic HD">Warlords Classic HD</a>). So buying it was the only option. Well how time is passing fast. I remember playing original when I was so young. I don't even understand much of the gameplay at the time. But from what I remember it was very climatic and engaging game. Like all games in that times I suppose.

<p>I bought that game mostly not for nostalgia but for searching for inspiration from all time classic. And what I found is that I already implement so much gameplay of warlords in Piradice. I was not aware of how similar those two games are. And that is awesome! I also found that my game is presenting very good next to the Warlords. I am really proud now. And it's still in production so will be only better :)</p>
