<h2>Sounds and music - the second half of game</h2>
<p>I would like to announce that @rezoner (Przemys≈Çaw Sikorski) is on the board as a music composer! He's very talented and will warm up the heart of the Piradice :)
</p>
<p>You can check his great games and lovely tunes at his home page:  <a href="http://rezoner.net" title="Javascript programmer, experimentator, gamedevelop">http://rezoner.net</a>

</li><li>world map generator shows config in hash url - useful for sharing or saving favorite maps
</li><li>ability to make PNG image of entire map with logo and #url :) (just remember that bigger maps will expand the saving process time )
</li></ul>
<h2>Hash in url?</h2>
<p>It works pretty simple. Each map is generated by some rules that change randomness. Those rules are showed in url after # and  you read them like this: #WIDTH|HEIGHT|SEED|ISLAND|ISLANDS_SIZE|GRASS|PALMS|CHESTS. 
</p>
<ul><li>WIDTH &amp; HEIGHT - size of map (in blocks)
</li><li>SEED - whatever string for random generator
</li><li>ISLANDS - number of points to start generating terrain
</li><li>ISLANDS_SIZE - generator expand each "island" using this number
</li><li>GRASS, PALMS - generator use this numbers to push/reduce randomness (there's more rules for grass and palms)
</li><li>CHESTS - actual number of chests (if there is space for them)
</li></ul>
<p>You can change those numbers and experiment with results or simply press the [random] button in menu ( recommended ). Some values may don't work while some may results in awesome maps.
