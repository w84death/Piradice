<h2>Always Learning</h2>

<p>I bought a book! <strong>HTML5 Canvas, 2nd Edition</strong>, Native Interactivity and Animation for the Web by Steve Fulton and Jeff Fulton. It's now somewhere between my and O'RELLY shop so I must wait now. It will surly help me finish my game and expand my knowledge of canvas.</p>
<p>I will like to say thanks to the authors for giving me discount. For indie developers every dollar is important.</p>
