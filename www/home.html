  <p>Piradice is a game about pirates searching for the mighty treasures. It's a simple but in a same time complex strategy gaem for two players. On one hand it seems very random but on other hand good, strategic decisions will pay off.</p>
  <p>The overall rules are simple but the units have some individual abilites and there's some buil in strategies to master. Maps are proceduraly generated so You'll never play the same game.</p>
  
  <h2>The game is still in development!</h2>
